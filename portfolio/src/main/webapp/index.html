    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p id="abtme">Welcome to my site! My name is Praneet Mekala and I'm currently a rising sophomore at MIT, majoring in computer science. I enjoy all kinds of computer science topics, from web dev to algorithmic problem solving, but my favorite application of computer
      science is in simulation softwares. I love working through problems, trying different approaches until I reach an end point that I'm satisfied with. </p>

      <h4>Analysis of Biomaterials for Optimal Scaffolding Usage</h4>
      <p>
        This was a project I did during my junior year of high school. Interested in biology at the time, I chose to do a project that combined both my computer science and biology interests into one. The project consisted of two major components: a lab component
        and a software component. In the lab, I created synthetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_Engineering#Scaffolds" target="_blank">bioscaffolds</a> and tested the mechanical properties of those, as well as the mechanical properties
        of "natures scaffolds" (extracellular matrix). The software component consisted of creating a database of different materials used to make synthetic scaffolds as well as their mechanical properties, and creating a program which would read the
        database and output the synthetic material closest in all mechanical properties to natural tissue. Potential applications would be finding the best scaffold to use for a patient's tissue growth in a medical setting.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Project details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Created solutions ranging from 1% silk to 20% silk, and placed solutions in a freeze dryer</li>
        <li> Measured the stress/strain using an Instron Universal Testing Machine to measure the Young's modulus</li>
        <li>Decellularized chicken tissue to retrieve natural ECM, which was also tested on the Instron machine</li>
        <li>Used the Java based JDBC API with a MySQL database to store data and analyze it in Java.</li>
