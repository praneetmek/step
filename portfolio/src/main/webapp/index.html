    <hr>
    <p id="abtme">Welcome to my site! My name is Praneet Mekala and I'm currently a rising sophomore at MIT, majoring in computer science. I enjoy all kinds of computer science topics, from web dev to algorithmic problem solving. The area that I enjoy most in computer
      science is simulation software. I love working through problems, trying different approaches until I reach an end point that I'm satisfied with. </p>
